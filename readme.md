Mongoose Checkpoint Project

This is a simple Node.js + Mongoose project I created to practice how to connect a MongoDB Atlas database and perform basic CRUD operations like create, find, update, and delete.

What This Project Does
Connects to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose
Creates a simple Person schema
Allows adding, finding, updating, and deleting people from the database

Remember to keep your .env file private and never upload it to GitHub.
Always make sure your MONGO_URI has no extra spaces.
